## Demand Forecasting for Leading Beer ManufacturingCompany:

1. Developed a model to forecast the demand of the beer based on location,weekday, month, brand and subcategory within that brand using AR/ MA/ ARIMA/ SARIMAX
2. Data is pretty challenging due to the effect of covid. We got data that containsbefore covid and while covid season.
3. So we started with diagnostic analytics to understand more about the databefore going with modelling. Shared all the diagnostic reports with the vendorand based on    the review we proceeded with modelling using differentalgorithms like LSTMs & FB Prophet.
4. We still trying to increase the model accuracy with help of parameter tweakingand better pattern study and understanding the pattern between the errors. So,we can      take values to the business.
